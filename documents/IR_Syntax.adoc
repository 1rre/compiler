|Syntax | Usage
|`{function,${type},${name},${arity},${st}}` | Define a function `name` (identifier) with return type `type`, arity `arity` (integer), defining it as `st` (statement list).
|`{move,${data},${rd}}` | Copy the value of `data` (register, stack or immediate) to `rd` (register or stack)
|`{${op},${rd},[${ra},${rb}]}` | Perform the operation specified in `op` (BIF) on `ra` (register) and `rb` (register), storing the result in `rd` (register)
|`{test,${ra},${lb}}` | Branch to `lb` (label) if the value in `ra` is 0
|`{call,${fn},${ar},${ra}}` | Call `fn` (function) with `ar` (integer) arguments contiguous from `ra` (stack)
|`{label,${lb}}` | Create `lb` (label) which can be jumped to using `test`
|`{jump,${lb}}` | Unconditionally jump to `lb` (label)
|`return` | Return the value in register 0 to the calling function (this is fine for all functions as return value of void functions is undefined)
|`{allocate,${n}}` | Allocate `n` (integer) bits on the stack
|`{deallocate,${n}}` | Delete/deallocate `n` (integer) bits on the stack
|`{address,${rs},${rd}}` | Finds the memory location of the object in `rs` (register or stack) & stores a pointer to it in `rd` (register)
|`{load,${rs},${rd}}` | Finds the memory location pointed to by `rs` (register or stack) & stores the value in `rd` (register)
|`{store,${rs},${rd}}` | Stores the value in `rs` (register) in the memory location pointed to by `rd` (register)
|`{cast,${ra},${type}}` | Advises the compliler of a variable's `type` (in the form `reference level`, `type`, `width`) of a variable which would otherwise be incorrectly inferred, such as `char c = 5l;` -> `[{move,{long,5},${rd}}, {cast,${rd},{0,i,8}}]`
