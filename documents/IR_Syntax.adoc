= Syntax of the Intermediate Representation

== Global Statements
[%header,cols="3,5"]
|===
|Syntax | Usage
|`{function,<type>,<name>,<args>,<st>}` | Define a function `name` (identifier) with return type `type`, args `args` (list of types), defining it as `st` (scoped statement list).
|`{global,<type>,<name>,<data>}` | Declare a global variable `name` (identifier) with type `type` & initialise it to `data` (data statement list).
|===

== Data Statements
[%header,cols="3,5"]
|===
|Syntax | Usage
|`{data,<type>,init}` | Initialises a static space to  in the program data at compile time for `type` (in the form `reference level`, `type`, `width`)
|`{local,<data>}` | Declare a private section of an array& initialise it to `data` (data statement list).
|===

== Scoped Statements
[%header,cols="3,5"]
|===
|Syntax | Usage
|`{address,<rs>,<rd>}` | Finds the memory location of the object in `rs` (register or stack) & stores a pointer to it in `rd` (register)
|`{allocate,<n>}` | Allocate `n` (integer) bits on the stack
|`{call,<fn>,<ar>,<ra>}` | Call `fn` (function) with `ar` (integer) arguments contiguous from `ra` (stack)
|`{cast,<ra>,<type>}` | Advises the compiler of a variable's `type` (in the form `reference level`, `type`, `width`) of a variable which would otherwise be incorrectly inferred, such as `char c = 5l;` -> `[{move,{long,5>,<rd>>, {cast,<rd>,{0,i,8>}]`
|`{gc,<n>}` | Trim the local stack to `n` (integer) items & delete any associated data in the heap.
|`{jump,<lb>}` | Unconditionally jump to `lb` (label)
|`{label,<lb>}` | Create `lb` (label) which can be jumped to using `test`
|`{load,<rs>,<rd>}` | Finds the memory location pointed to by `rs` (register or stack) & stores the value in `rd` (register)
|`{move,<data>,<rd>}` | Copy the value of `data` (register, stack or immediate) to `rd` (register or stack)
|`return` | Return the value in register 0 to the calling function (this is fine for all functions as return value of void functions is undefined)
|`{store,<rs>,<rd>}` | Stores the value in `rs` (register) in the memory location pointed to by `rd` (register)
|`{test,<ra>,<lb>}` | Branch to `lb` (label) if the value in `ra` is 0
|`{<op>,[<ra>,<rb>],<rd>}` | Perform the operation specified in `op` (BIF) on `ra` (register) and `rb` (register), storing the result in `rd` (register)
|`{test_heap,<size>,<rd>}` | Allocate `size` (integer) bits on the heap & stores the address in rd.
|===

== Arguments
[%header,cols="3,5"]
|===
|Argument | Meaning
|`{x,<n>}` | Register `n` (integer), given an infinite register system
|`{y,<n>}` | The ``n``th (integer) item on the current function's part of the stack, which is mapped to an address
|`{z,<n>}` | The ``n``th argument to a function
|`{i,<n>}` | A literal with value `n` (integer). Assumed to be the default integer size for the platform.
|`{g,<str>}` | A global variable with name `str` (string). (subject to change as it hasn't yet been implemented)
|`{f,<N>}` | A literal with value `n` (float). Assumed to be the default float size for the platform.
|`{l,<N>}` | The label `n` (integer), numbering is global, however only labels within the same function are valid.
|`{<p>,<t>,<s>}` | A type with "reference level" `p` (integer), ie how many levels of dereferencing would be required to get the actual object, type `t` (char) (`f` for float, `i` for int and `n` for void), and width `s` (integer), which refers to the width of type `t` rather than any memory address.
