|Syntax | Usage
|`{move,${data},${rd}}` | Copy the value of `data` (register, memory or immediate) to `rd` (register or memory)
|`{${op},${rd},[${ra},${rb}]}` | Perform the operation specified in `op` (BIF) on `ra` (register) and `rb` (register), storing the result in `rd` (register)
|`{test,${ra},${lb}}` | Branch to `lb` (label) if the value in `ra` is 0
|`{call,${fn},${ar},${ra}}` | Call `fn` (function) with `ar` (integer) arguments contiguous from `ra` (register)
|`{label,${lb}}` | Create `lb` (label) which can be jumped to using `test`
|`{jump,${lb}}` | Unconditionally jump to `lb` (label)
|`return` | return the value in register 0 to the calling function (this is fine for all functions as return value of void functions is undefined).
