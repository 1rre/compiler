= C Compiler

== Compiling from source
run `make bin/c_compiler`

== Compilation to MIPS
=== From ANSI C
A C source file can be compiled to MIPS assembly using the `-S` switch, such as in `bin/c_compiler -S <file>``.

=== From SegFault Bytecode
A Segfault bytecode file can be compiled to MIPS assembly using the `-ir` and `-S` switches together, such as in `bin/c_compiler -ir -S <file>`.

=== Directing Output
Mips code can be output to a file using the `-o <output_file>` switch, such as in `bin/c_compiler -S <input_file> -o <output_file>`

=== Debug Mode
Debug mode can be enabled using the `-d` switch, and prints the AST & IR before generating the assembly.
It also prints the raw representation of the assembly before it is printed.

== Compilation to SegFault Bytecode
=== From ANSI C
A C source file can be compiled to SegFault Bytecode using the `-ir` switch, such as in `bin/c_compiler -ir <input_file>`.

== Bytecode interpreter
An interpreter for SegFault bytecode with a working stack has been included in the compiler.
=== Normal Mode
The interpreter can be run using the `-vm` switch & takes a single C source file & runs the *last* function in the file, calling it with any integer arguments supplied on the command line, such as in `bin/c_compiler -vm <input_file> <arg1> ...`.

=== Debug Mode
The debug output can be enabled with the `-d` switch.
This prints the state of the stack & registers, next instruction to be executed & the type of each data value, along with a few other useful insights which can be used when testing the compilation of C programs to the IR.

== Testing
A test script, `test.sh`, has been included which will run any tests 1 subdirectory deep in the `compiler_tests` folder.
An indication is given as to whether the test passed or failed, and if it failed a reason is given.
The percentage of tests passed is printed at the end of testing.

== IR Syntax

=== Global Statements
[%header,cols="3,5"]
|===
|Syntax | Usage
|`{function,<type>,<name>,<args>,<st>}` | Define a function `name` (identifier) with return type `type`, args `args` (list of types), defining it as `st` (scoped statement list).
|`{global,<type>,<name>,<data>}` | Declare a global variable `name` (identifier) with type `type` & initialise it to `data` (either `local` or `data` statement).
|===

=== Data Statements
[%header,cols="3,5"]
|===
|Syntax | Usage
|`{data,<type>,<init>}` | Initialises a static space in the program data at compile time for `type` & initialises that space to `init` (in the form `reference level`, `type`, `width`)
|`{local,<data>}` | Declare a subsection of an array (as stated in an initialiser list) & initialise it to `data` (data statement list).
|===

=== Scoped Statements
[%header,cols="3,5"]
|===
|Syntax | Usage
|`{address,<rs>,<rd>}` | Finds the memory location of the object in `rs` (register or stack) & stores a pointer to it in `rd` (register)
|`{allocate,<n>}` | Allocate `n` (integer) bits on the stack
|`{call,<fn>,<ar>,<ra>}` | Call `fn` (function) with `ar` (integer) arguments contiguous from `ra` (stack)
|`{cast,<ra>,<type>}` | Advises the compiler of a variable's `type` (in the form `reference level`, `type`, `width`) of a variable which would otherwise be incorrectly inferred, such as `char c = 5l;` -> `[{move,{i,5},<rd>}, {cast,<rd>,{0,i,8>}]`
|`{gc,<n>}` | Trim the local stack to `n` (integer) items & delete any associated data in the heap.
|`{jump,<lb>}` | Unconditionally jump to `lb` (label)
|`{label,<lb>}` | Create `lb` (label) which can be jumped to using `test`
|`{load,<rs>,<rd>}` | Finds the memory location pointed to by `rs` (register or stack) & stores the value in `rd` (register)
|`{move,<data>,<rd>}` | Copy the value of `data` (register, stack or immediate) to `rd` (register or stack)
|`return` | Return the value in register 0 to the calling function (this is fine for all functions as return value of void functions is undefined)
|`{store,<rs>,<rd>}` | Stores the value in `rs` (register) in the memory location pointed to by `rd` (register)
|`{test,<ra>,<lb>}` | Branch to `lb` (label) if the value in `ra` is 0
|`{<op>,[<ra>,<rb>],<rd>}` | Perform the operation specified in `op` (BIF) on `ra` (register) and `rb` (register), storing the result in `rd` (register)
|===

=== Arguments
[%header,cols="3,5"]
|===
|Argument | Meaning
|`{x,<n>}` | Register `n` (integer), given an infinite register system
|`{y,<n>}` | The ``n``th (integer) item on the current function's part of the stack, which is mapped to an address
|`{z,<n>}` | The ``n``th argument to a function
|`{i,<n>}` | A literal with value `n` (integer).
|`{g,<str>}` | A global variable with name `str` (string). (subject to change as it hasn't yet been implemented)
|`{f,<N>}` | A literal with value `n` (float)
|`{l,<N>}` | The label `n` (integer), numbering is global, however only labels within the same function are valid.
|`{<p>,<t>,<s>}` | A type with "reference level" `p` (integer), ie how many levels of dereferencing would be required to get the actual object, type `t` (char: `f` for float, `i` for int and `n` for void, which is only used internally), and width `s` (integer), which refers to the width of type `t` rather than any memory address.
