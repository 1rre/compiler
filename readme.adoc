= C Compiler

== Progress
The parser seems to work, time to make type checker, translator etc.

If we want we can make the type checker in C++ using a NIF - more info link:https://erlang.org/doc/man/erl_nif.html[here].

It's almost certainly also a good idea to improve the AST to make it more obvious what is being produced and what is expected

== Compilation
To compile everything so you can run an eshell in `.build`, chmod "build.erl" and run `./build.erl compile`.

To compile a runnable escript, run `./build.erl bin/compiler` (or just `./build.erl`)
