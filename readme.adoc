= C Compiler

== The parser seems to work, time to make type checker etc.

I might do that in CPP - the command to compile a NIF is g++ -o \<<NIF_LIB>>.so -fpic -shared \<<NIF_CPP>>.cpp -I /lib/erlang/\<<erts-11.1.7>>/include

replace \<<erts-11.1.7>> with whatever version you may have - there should be a way to find that out that at runtime but I'll figure that out later.

== Compilation
To compile everything so you can run an eshell in `.build`, chmod "build.erl" and run `./build.erl compile`.

To compile a runnable escript, run `./build.erl bin/compiler` (or just `./build.erl`)
